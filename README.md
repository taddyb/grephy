# grepy
A python script which emulates grep.

To start the script, use the command `python grepy.py [inputfile] [nfa-file]` 

Currently the script only prints out the alphabet and an NFA for simple strings containing only numbers and letters. 

Working on creating nfa's for all regular expressions.
